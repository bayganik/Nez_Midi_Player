ECS is used to allow for separation of concern when coding. For example, I choose to update my components using a separate "System".  
However, You will find most examples of NEZ to be using updates inside "Components".  I don't like that.  NEZ is flexible enough to allow you to choose which way to go !!

I used Sanford library for MIDI files.  Its a wonderful library for reading/writing and playing MIDI files.
