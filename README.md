ECS is used to allow of separation of concern when coding. So I choose to update my components using a System.  You will find most examples of NEZ
of NEZ to be using updates inside Components.  I don't like that.  NEZ is flexible enough to allow you to choose which way to go !!

I used Sanford library for MIDI files.  Its a wonderful library for reading/writing and playing MIDI files.
